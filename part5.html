<p>Besides all the power in the Vi/Ex editor, there's a lot of
flexibility in it, too.  You've already met some of this
adaptability when I pointed out various ways to perform many
editing functions.  Now it's time to meet phase two of editor
flexibility -- the myriad ways to modify the editor's internal
operations.
</p>


<p>There's no ``setup mode'' for changing these parameters.
Instead, all the changes are made with line-mode commands, which
can be interspersed with ordinary editing commands.  That is, you
give the commands from the prompt, as usual, if you are editing
in line
 mode.  When you are editing in visual (or screen) mode,
precede these environment-modifying commands with a colon, as you
would with any other line-mode commands you specify in visual
mode.
</p>


<p>These modifications take effect as soon as you give the
commands.  They stay in effect as long as you run the editor
program.  You can switch from editing one file to another -- as
with any of the 
<code><strong>edit, next, rewind
</strong></code>
commands -- without affecting the editing environment you've set
up.  And, you can revoke or further modify any environmental
changes you've made at any time, by using the same commands or
variant forms of them.
</p>


<p>Your environment setup does go away when you quit the editor
altogether.  The next time you invoke the editor you'll find that
all the environment parameters have returned to their default
values.  (This can be a blessing in disguise, because there is no
direct way to tell the editor to restore all parameters to
default settings.)
</p>


<p>When you've found
 a combination of settings you'd like to use
again, there are ways to have these settings established
automatically (or semi-automatically) whenever you invoke the
editor.  You can even have several of these preset environments -- 
which one is used will depend on the circumstances in which you
invoke the editor.  I'll explain how to automate the settings at
the end of this tutorial.
</p>


<h3><a name="section1"></a>The 
<code><strong>set
</strong></code>
Command
</a></h3>


<p>Most of your setup will be accomplished by a single command
that controls around fifty editor variables that affect the
editing environment.  The 
<code><strong>set
</strong></code>
command, for which 
<code><strong>se
</strong></code> is the
shortest abbreviation, sets variables having three different
types of values: string, numeric, and boolean.  Consider the
examples here:
</p>


<pre><strong>
set report=7
set term=vt100
set terse
set nomagic

</strong></pre>


<p>Because the first two examples are assignments, they must
specify either string or num
eric values.  The first is numeric;
here, 
<code><strong>report=7
</strong></code> tells the editor to
give you a report (warning message) whenever a command changes
seven or more lines -- the default is five or more lines.
</p>


<p>The second example assigns a string value; the numerals
in it are regarded as merely characters by the editor.  The

<code><strong>term=vt100
</strong></code> directive tells the
editor to address your terminal as though it were a DEC model
VT100.  (You specify one of the listed short names for the terminal -- 
obtained from the Termcap or Terminfo terminal-description
systems -- as its string value.)  The default for this variable
is to use the terminal type from your log-in shell environment
(the value assigned to your 
<code>TERM
</code> variable), if
available -- and if not available, then address your terminal as
though it were a ``dumb'' terminal.
</p>


<p>The last two examples (without equal signs) illustrate boolean
variables, which can be either on (enabled) or off (disabled). Yo
u
turn a boolean variable on just by giving its name after the

<code><strong>set
</strong></code> command.  The first of these
two boolean examples tells the editor to make any error messages
very brief: cryptic to inexperienced users, but convenient for
people who are quite familiar with the editor.  The default for
this variable is ``off'' or ``disabled'', which provides longer,
more explanatory error messages.
</p>


<p>To turn a boolean variable off, just give its name prefixed by
the string ``no'' without any intervening space characters.  The
last of these examples turns off the special (``magic'')
interpretation of several metacharacters, as discussed in 
<a href="009.part1.html#section3">an earlier part of this
tutorial dealing with search patterns
</a>.  The usual default for
this variable's value is ``magic'', which means all
metacharacters have their special interpretation -- but if you
invoke the editor by the name 
<code><strong>edit
</strong></code>
or 
<code><strong>vedit
</strong></code>, then ``nomagi
c'' is the
default value (no special interpretation of these particular
metacharacters).
</p>


<p>There's no need to use several distinct

<code><strong>set
</strong></code> commands when you want to
change a number of these variables.  A single command can have
almost any number of arguments.  So all four of the example
commands above could be replaced by this single command:
</p>


<pre><strong>
set report=7 term=vt100 terse nomagic

</strong></pre>


<p>Variant forms of this command will tell you the present status
of individual variables, all that have been changed, or all the
variables.  For instance, type ``set'' without any arguments to
tell the editor to display a list of all the variables that have
been changed from their default values, along with their current
values.
</p>


<p>Type ``set all'' to display all the variables and their
values, whether changed from default or not.  This is a good way
to check which variables your version of the editor recognizes,
and what their default values actually are -- so
me proprietary
versions of the editor have played with both these factors.
</p>


<p>If you want to check the values of only one or a few variables,
you don't have to scan through a long list -- you can run a

<code><strong>set
</strong></code> command that will report the
settings of only the variables you specify.  For a boolean variable,
just give the name of the variable, immediately followed by a
question mark, as an argument to the command.  For a string- or
numeric-valued variable, you only need to specify the name itself,
without the equal sign.  Thus, typing:
</p>


<pre><strong>
set report magic?

</strong></pre>


<p>will produce a response like this:
</p>


<pre>
report=7 nomagic

</pre>


<p>If the details of checking individual variables seem too arcane
to remember, the editor will cut you some slack: You may specify
the name of a boolean variable in its ``no'' form, and you may give
a non-boolean variable with an unneeded question mark at the end of
it, and your query will still work.  So typing:
</p>


<pre><strong>
set report? nomagic?

</strong></pre>


<p>will produce the same result as the previous query did.
</p>


<p>You can even mix option settings with inquiries in the same

<code><strong>set
</strong></code> command, in any order.  For
example, if you want to turn on

<code><strong>number
</strong></code> and set

<code><strong>report
</strong></code> to warn you whenever even
three lines are changed, and also want to know what terminal type
the editor thinks you are using and whether

<code><strong>terse
</strong></code> is on or off, any one of the
following command lines will take care of it all:
</p>


<pre><strong>
set number report=3 term terse?
set term terse? number report=3
set term number terse? report=3

</strong></pre>


<p>Below, I've listed some important editor variables that modify
the visual display, with an explanation of each.  If two names
are specified, the first is the full name and the other is the
shortest recognized abbreviation.  The full name will appear in
the lists displayed when you type
 ``set'' by itself or type ``set
all''.
</p>



<h3><a name="section2"></a><code><strong>set
</strong></code> Command
Variables that Control How to Paint the Screen
</a></h3>



<h4><code>number nu
</code></h4>


<p>You already know that the editor assigns a number to every
line in your file, and changes line numbers every time you add or
delete lines, in order to keep the numbers consecutive.  The

<code><strong>number
</strong></code> boolean variable tells the
editor to display those line numbers next to every file line that
appears on the screen, in both screen and line-editing modes.
You just have to turn it on; it's off by default.  If you have a
window that looks like this:
</p>


<pre>
COLOR CODING FOR POWER WIRES
green     ground
white     neutral
black     hot
red       hot

</pre>


<p>turning on this variable will make it look something
like this:
</p>


<pre>
  158  COLOR CODING FOR POWER WIRES
  159  green     ground
  160  white     neutral
  161  black     hot
  162  red       hot

</pre>


<p>The displayed numbers
 do not become part of the file, and
nothing you can do, deliberate or accidental, will cause your
editing to interact with the line numbers.
</p>



<h4><code>list
</code></h4>


<p>Turning on this off-by-default variable makes two changes
in the way file lines are displayed on the screen, whether in
line- or screen-editing mode:
</p>


<ol>


<li>The end of each line is marked by a dollar sign.  (This
applies to actual line ends, not to places where the editor wraps
a long line so it can all be displayed on the screen.)
</li><br><br>


<li>Every tab character is replaced by a circumflex-capital-I
(``^I'') character sequence.  (This means that columns that were
kept in alignment by preceding tabs will not be displayed aligned
with this variable enabled.)
</li>


</ol>


<p>Taking the same sample screen as in the previous example, when
the 
<code><strong>list
</strong></code> variable is on, the screen
would look like this:
</p>


<pre>
COLOR CODING FOR POWER WIRES$
green^Iground$
white^Ineutral$
black^Ihot$
red^Ihot$

</pre>


<p>This variable affects display only, the contents of the file
are not changed in any way.  The 
<code><strong>list
</strong></code> 
and 
<code><strong>number
</strong></code> variables are compatible.  
Enabling them both would produce a display like this:
</p>


<pre>
  158  COLOR CODING FOR POWER WIRES$
  159  green^Iground$
  160  white^Ineutral$
  161  black^Ihot$
  162  red^Ihot$

</pre>



<h4><code>window=
</code></h4>


<p>The numeric value of this variable tells the editor how many
screen lines should be in the editing window (in screen-editing
mode). The default is one less than the size of your screen or
window.  This variable's value cannot be changed while you are in
screen-editing mode.
</p>



<h4><code>scroll
</code></h4>


<p>A numeric variable that sets the number of lines to be
scrolled down by a control-D or up by a control-U command.  The

<code><strong>z
</strong></code> command uses twice this count as
the number of lines to display.  Default value is half the size
of the screen or window.
</p>


<p>You can give a count prior to one of those scrolling commands,
which will override the value of the

<code><strong>scroll
</strong></code> variable.  For example,
typing ``3control-D'' will scroll forward just three lines.
</p>


<p><em>Caution:
</em> The editor will remember any count you give,
and use that count -- instead of the value assigned to

<code><strong>scroll
</strong></code> -- with any future command
you give without specifying a new count.  Because the value of
the 
<code><strong>scroll
</strong></code> variable remains
unchanged, even though it is no longer being used, the

<code><strong>set
</strong></code> command has no way to undo this
new behavior.  The only way to go back to using the value set for

<code><strong>scroll
</strong></code> is to look up that value --
type ``set scroll'' -- then use this value as a count preceding
another of the commands that normally use the

<code><strong>scroll
</strong></code> variable.
</p>



<h3><a name="sectionT"></a>Playing ``
<code>tag
</code>''
</a></h3>


<p>If your edi
ting work requires jumping from place to place in
numerous files, it would be convenient to index the places you
visit most.  The editor has a system for handling this.  It's
pretty simple, too; you set up one or more reference lists, then
you can go to the place within the file that you want just by
typing a few characters.
</p>


<p><em>Caution:
</em> the ``tags'' system described below does
not simply switch focus briefly to another file.  It ends
your editing of the current file, then loads the new file into
the editor with the standard context changes, just as if you
had given an 
<code><strong>edit
</strong></code> command.  As
a consequence of this, the editor will normally refuse to execute
a 
<code><strong>tag
</strong></code> command when the file you are
presently editing has changes which you have not yet written to
permanent storage.  If you choose to override this protection,
give the command as 
<code><strong>tag!
</strong></code> or

<code><strong>ta!
</strong></code>.
</p>


<p>To use this system, you nee
d to set up at least one ``tags''
file containing references to your file destinations.  If
programming is your work and you use C, C++, Pascal,
FORTRAN, lex or yacc, the Unix 
<a href="/unixworld/man/ctags.1"><code><strong>ctags
</strong></code></a> 
utility can set up a suitable ``tags'' file for you.  If not,
it isn't all that difficult to build such a file yourself.
</p>


<p>Each line in a ``tags'' file is a complete reference to a
place you might want to go.  The line has five parts, which
(reading from left to right) are:
</p>


<ol>


<li>The short name you will use to refer to the particular file
and the place in it.  Don't start choosing names, though, until
you've read the 
<a href="009.part5.html#third-way">third way to invoke a
tag
</a>, below.
</li><br><br>


<li>One tab character, as a separator.  A space character will
not do here.
</li><br><br>


<li>The name of the destination file.  This can be a simple name,
if the file is in your current directory, or a path name, if
not.
</li><br><br>


<li>Another tab character.  Agai
n, a space character won't do.
</li><br><br>


<li>A line-mode search command that will find the place you want
within the file.  As you may have cleverly deduced, you can
string multiple commands together here with the vertical-bar
(``|'') character, and can use editing commands if you want the
file pre-edited.  Spaces and even tabs may appear in this string
if needed; only the first two tabs in a line are interpreted as
field separators.
</li>


</ol>


<p>If this file structure sounds a little complex, look at this
short example of a ``tags'' file to see how things actually
work out:
</p>


<pre><strong>
difid   ../math/calc    /^APPENDIX/;/^C. Differen
integ   ../math/calc    /^APPENDIX/;/^D. Integrals
log     /adm/err-log    1;?Err-7$
rvlog   /adm/err-log    g/^/m0|0;/Err-7$
vocab   %      /^GLOSSARY
words   %      /^GLOSSARY

</strong></pre>


<p>The first line in the example above provides that using
``difid'' as a tag will take the user to edit a file named
``
<code>calc
</code>'', in a directory with relative p
ath name
``
<code>../math
</code>''. (
<em>Note:
</em> that using this tag
will not change the current directory of the user's shell; only
the file being edited is changed.)  Once that file has been
loaded, the editor will seek out the first line that starts with
``APPENDIX'', and go from there to the next line that begins with
``C. Differen''.
</p>



<p>Yes, you can specify different tags to enter the same file at
different points.  My second example line contains a tag that leads
to a different place in the same file.  After the editor has
searched out the first line beginning ``APPENDIX'', as before, it
goes on to a different section of the appendix.
</p>


<p>You can even use multiple tags to enter the
file at the same point, but with different preliminary
editing.  My ``log'' and ``rvlog'' tags go to the same file and
the same line -- the most recently appended line that ends with
``Err-7''.  The difference is that the ``rvlog'' tag first
reverses the order of lines in the file.  (Note that the search
command f
or the two tags is different, because in the second
case the line being sought has been moved to a different
position in the file.)
</p>


<p>And you can use a tag to move to a place in the file you are
already editing.  In the last two example lines I have used the
percent sign (
<code><strong>%
</strong></code>) to indicate
``current file''; the pound-sign (
<code><strong>#
</strong></code>) 
for ``alternate file'' is also acceptable.  These tags move the
user to the glossary section of the document currently being
edited, whatever that document may be.  If I were to invoke a
tag with an actual file name in it, and that file happened to be
the file I was presently editing, the effect would be the
same.
</p>


<p>Finally, you undoubtedly saw that the last two entries in my
tags file are identical except for the tag names.  Either tag
will take you to the same place in the same file with no
preliminary editing.  This is legitimate, and often useful.
You may be building a tag file for multiple users -- some of
these u
sers are accustomed to a certain tag name for a given
file and location, some to another tag name.  The tags system
allows you to accommodate both groups.
</p>


<p>You may have noticed that the lines in my example file are
arranged in ASCII-sort order.  This is necessary to keep the
tag-search mechanism from missing the tag you specify.
If you don't trust your own ability to sort the lines, the Unix 
<a href="/unixworld/man/sort.1"><code><strong>sort
</strong></code></a>
utility can do it for you.
</p>


<p>When you've built your ``tags'' file, you need a place to put
it.  Ordinarily, when you invoke a tag name, the editor first
tries to look it up in a file named ``
<code>tags
</code>'' in your
current directory.  If it fails to find such a file, it then
looks for 
<code>/usr/lib/tags
</code>.  But you can override these
defaults by setting a different value for the ``tags'' file in
your editing environment.  For instance, if you include this
command in your setup file:
</p>


<pre><strong>
set tags=moretags

</strong></pre>


<p>then tag searches will take place in a file named ``moretags''
in your current directory.
</p>


<p>With everything set up, you only need to know how to invoke a
tag as needed.  There are three or four ways to do it, all
enumerated below:
</p>


<ol>


<li><p>When you invoke the editor from your shell's command line
you can use the ``-t'' command-line option flag to specify a
tagged item instead of naming a file to edit.  For example,
typing the line (from your shell prompt):
</p>


<pre><strong>
vi -t chap3

</strong></pre>


<p>tells the editor to look up the ``chap3'' tag to find the
destination file and location in that file.  Oddly enough, you
can list some file names to edit as well as a tag (with ``-t'') on
the editor-invocation command line.  The rule is that the first
string of non-whitespace characters immediately following the
``-t'' flag is regarded by the editor as a tag name; any other
such strings that don't begin with a ``-'' character are taken
as actual names of files.  However, the tagged and
 the
named files aren't remembered the same way in this case.
</p>


<p>For instance, if you specify a tag, then two file names,
the editor will initially place you
in the tagged file and when you type

<code><strong>:next
</strong></code> you will move to the first
named file, and another 
<code><strong>:n
</strong></code> (the
shortest abbreviation) takes you to the second named file.  But,
the tagged file does not appear on the argument list -- viewed
with the 
<code><strong>args
</strong></code> command -- so when you
enter a 
<code><strong>:rewind
</strong></code> command you return
to the first named file, not the tagged file, even though it was
specified first on the command line.
</p></li>


<li>While you are editing a file, you can invoke a tag with the
line-mode command 
<code><strong>tag
</strong></code> (shortest
abbreviation, 
<code><strong>ta
</strong></code>) followed by a
space and the tag name.  This command can be given from screen
mode as 
<code><strong>:tag
</strong></code>, of course.
</li><br><br>


<li><p><a name="third-way"></a>While you are in screen mode, you can
put the cursor on either the first letter of a word or the space
immediately preceding it and then type a ``control-]'' character.
This has the same effect as if you'd typed the word the cursor is
at as the argument to a 
<code><strong>:tag
</strong></code>
command.
</a></p>


<p><em>Caution:
</em> A ``control-]'' is the default Telnet
``escape'' character.  So if you are editing on a remote system
during a Telnet session and enter a ``control-]'', control will
return to Telnet, which will interpret what you type next as a
Telnet command.  You could change the Telnet escape character
when you start your remote terminal session in order to use
``control-]'' with the editor.
</p></li>


<li>Some newer versions of the editor maintain a stack of tags.
If so, you can repeat the last

<code><strong>:tag
</strong></code> command you gave in screen
mode by typing ``control-T''. This can take a count, so that
typing a ``2'' and then a ``control-T'' repeats the

<code><strong>:tag
</strong></code> command preceding the last one
you gave, etcetera.
</li>


</ol>


<h3><a name="sectionL"></a>Making Your Environment Setup Automatic
</a></h3>


<p>When you've worked out an editing environment setup that you
will want to use frequently, or even occasionally, there is no
need to type in all the changes from default every time you start
up the editor.  Because these are all line-mode editor commands,
there are several ways to define them automatically, all or some
of the time.
</p>


<p>If there is an editor start-up file (which must be named

<code>.exrc
</code>) in your home directory (the dot at the start
of the name is essential and the ``rc'' abbreviation means ``run
command''), the editor will interpret it every time you invoke
the editor and execute (or at least attempt to execute) the lines
in the file as line-mode commands before it turns editing control
over to you.  This applies to environment-setting commands as
well as others, so placing your set-up commands somewhere in this
file wi
ll cause the setup to happen every time you invoke the
editor.
</p>


<p>There are drawbacks to this approach, though.  You can only
have one environment preset this way: the editor will use that
same environment every time you invoke the editor.  One way to
provide more flexibility is to maintain several files with
various setups in them, and before you enter the editor, rename
the appropriate one of those start-up files to 
<code>.exrc
</code>
and when you leave the editor, restore its original name.  But
you shouldn't have to deal with anything this cumbersome just to
control your editing environment.
</p>


<p>The creators of the editor have provided a much better
solution.  Before the editor looks in your home directory for a
start-up file, it first looks in the directory from which you
invoked the editor.  If it finds a file named 
<code>.exrc
</code>
there, it interprets that as the start-up file instead of the

<code>.exrc
</code> file in your home directory.
</p>


<p>That behavior lets you have a special setup
 for each directory
in which you might want to do some editing.  For instance, let's
say you have a directory of shell scripts, another containing
chapters from a book you're writing, still another you use for
writing e-mail, plus one where you store and edit error logs --
you can have a separate editing environment for each of these
purposes.  And if you invoke the editor from a directory where
you don't maintain a separate start-up file, the one in your home
directory will be used.  Just remember to change to the directory
where the target file(s) are located before invoking the editor.
</p>


<p><em>Caution:
</em> If you invoke the editor from a directory
different from the one containing the file you're editing,
the editor will interpret the start-up file from your start-up
directory, and not use the intended environment (defined by the

<code>.exrc
</code> file in the directory where the target file
resides).
</p>


<p>One caveat about multiple 
<code>.exrc
</code> files, though.
In Unix System V and its successor
s, a security feature restricts
the editor's access to 
<code>.exrc
</code> files that are not in
your home directory.  The editor will not interpret a

<code>.exrc
</code> file that's not in your home directory, unless
you also have a 
<code>.exrc
</code> file that does live in your
home directory, and that file contains a line that sets the

<code>exrc
</code> boolean variable.
</p>


<p>The security hazard that this complex proviso guards against
is a real one.  Let's say you need to edit several files that are
in a directory like 
<code>/tmp
</code>, 
<code>/var/tmp
</code> or
some other directory that is writable by all users.  To save the
trouble of providing a full path name every time you want want to
switch from one file to another, you could easily change
directories (that is, ``cd'' to the directory where these files
are located). But when you want to start editing a file, the
Vi/Ex editor may find a Trojan horse file named

<code>.exrc
</code> placed in your current directory by a cracker
to await victims.  Of co
urse, the commands in this false editor
start-up file will be run with your account ownership.  These
commands aren't limited to editor set-up commands, but may be any
shell command that you're allowed to run, including ones to wipe
out your files, reset file permissions to allow public access to
confidential data, send indelicate comments to your boss using
utilities like 
<a href="/unixworld/man/write.1"><code><strong>write
</strong></code></a> 
combined with 
<a href="/unixworld/man/banner.1"><code><strong>banner
</strong></code></a>, 
and so forth.
</p>


<p>Now, perhaps you work on files that have different kinds of
material in different sections, and you want to be able to make a
complete change of editing environment whenever you move from one
section to another.  In this case, use the

<code><strong>source
</strong></code> command, with

<code><strong>so
</strong></code> as its shortest
abbreviation.
</p>


<p>The 
<code><strong>source
</strong></code> line-mode command can
be given at any time, although you may have to
 give it from 
line-editing mode, not from screen mode with a preceding colon.  It
takes one argument, a file name or path name, and its function is
to read the named set-up file and attempt to execute the lines in
it as a series of line-mode commands.
</p>


<p>Whether or not you can specify this command successfully in
screen mode depends on the editor version you are using.  Some
early versions were quite serious about prohibiting multiple-line
line-mode commands while in screen mode.  So serious that these
versions will execute only the first line of a script that has
been sourced in while the user is in screen mode.  If you don't
encounter this behavior, you can ignore this warning.  If you do,
you at least know where the problem lies.
</p>


<p>Now that you understand editor start-up files, I can
acknowledge that the one you put in you home directory is not
strictly necessary.  The editor will accept the value of a shell
environment variable named 
<code>EXINIT
</code> as the string of
line-mode commands to be
 run whenever the editor starts up.  But
I don't recommend going this route, for several reasons:
</p>


<ul>


<li>Usually the shell has a strict limit on the number of
characters for the value of an environment variable, whereas the
size of a 
<code>.exrc
</code> file is practically unlimited.  As
you get better at using the editor, you can easily develop a 
home-directory start-up file that is too large for

<code>EXINIT
</code>.
</li><br><br>


<li>A start-up file can be changed by simple editing, but
you have to redefine the 
<code>EXINIT
</code> variable from 
scratch.
</li><br><br>


<li>A change in your start-up file takes effect the next time you
invoke the editor, whereas if your 
<code>EXINIT
</code> variable
is defined in a shell start-up file, it's new definition won't
take effect until you log-in again or explicitly ``source'' the
shell start-up file from the shell's command line.
</li><br><br>


<li>When you want to restore the editor's environment variables
to their beginning state, you can simply source in th
e editor
start-up file.  There's no way to do this with the

<code>EXINIT
</code> shell variable.
</li>


</ul>


<p>You can use 
<code><strong>source
</strong></code> to execute an
editor set-up file from anywhere in your file space.  It will
also execute any file of line-mode commands, no matter what the
file name.  For example, let's say you have a special environment
setup that you never use at the beginning of an editing job, but
you do need it to edit tables.  You invoke the editor as always,
but when you're ready to edit your tables, you run a command
like:
</p>


<pre><strong>
:so table-defs

</strong></pre>


<p>where the 
<code>table-defs
</code> file contains line-mode
commands that set up the editor for table editing.
</p>


<p>When you specify a file of line-mode editing commands with

<code><strong>source
</strong></code> to perform, say, a
frequently used edit automatically, it's probably a good idea to
have commands in that file to return the editing environment to
what it was before the editing commands were
 run, assuming the
environment was changed for the editing task.
</p>


<p><em>Caution:
</em> If you decide to use environment set-up files
that you specify while you are editing -- you can't always depend
on default values.  For example, the

<code><strong>autoindent
</strong></code> variable is disabled
(``off'') by default.  So if you are setting up a start-up file
that will only be used at the beginning of editor sessions, and
you don't want to use autoindenting, you don't need to do
anything to leave it turned off.  But if you plan to occasionally
use that set-up file in the middle of a session, you have to ask
yourself, ``Will I ever use this setup in a case where I
previously had autoindenting turned on, either by another set-up
file or because I manually turned it on?''  If the answer that
question is ``Yes'', then the set-up file you're writing must
contain a 
<code><strong>set noai
</strong></code> command to be
sure that autoindentation is definitely disabled.
</p>


<p>And, what if the 
<code><strong>source
</strong></code> command
is broken in your version of the editor?  There is still a way to
make semiautomatic environment changes.  You have to use the 
line-mode 
<code><strong>read
</strong></code> command plus a 
little-known feature of letter-named storage buffers.
</p>


<p>You're probably accustomed to using the ``a'' through ``z''
named buffers for storing pieces of text, and returning these
pieces to the main document with commands like

<code><strong>"jp
</strong></code>, which returns the contents of
the ``j'' buffer right after the cursor position in visual mode.
Well, you can also use a visual-mode command of the form

<code><strong>@j
</strong></code>, which takes the text from the
``j'' buffer and executes it as a visual-mode command string.
For instance, if buffer ``j'' contains ``257G3dd'' as its text,
then typing 
<code><strong>@j
</strong></code> will move the cursor
to line 257 and delete that line and the two that follow it.
</p>


<p>The text in the buffer must be commands you could give
from visual m
ode for this feature to work, but that includes
line-mode commands that are preceded by a colon and terminated
with a carriage-return character.  So if buffer ``h'' contains
the lines:
</p>


<pre><strong>
:se nomesg terse list
:map v :!wc -w %^M
1G

</strong></pre>


<p>then typing ``@h'' will reset three variables, map a command
string, and move the cursor to the first line in the file.
</p>


<p>There are a few points you should keep well in mind when you
are placing line-mode commands into a letter-named buffer for
future execution.  All of them revolve around the fact that the
editor is expecting screen-mode commands from this source.
</p>


<ul>


<li>Any line-mode command must fit entirely on a single line.
</li><br><br>


<li>A line-mode command must begin with a colon character.
</li><br><br>


<li>A line-mode command may begin at the start of a line of text
or in the middle of it, but it must end at the end of the line.
At execution time, the newline character at the end of the text
line is what tells the editor
 that this particular command is
ended and a new command (either line- or screen-mode) will
follow.
</li><br><br>


<li>Never put a line break in buffer text you will execute as a
command string unless a carriage return is part of the command
string at that point.
</li>


</ul>


<p>To import this set-up command list from an outside file to the
``h'' buffer, use the 
<code><strong>read
</strong></code> command.
For example, if your three-line set-up file is named

<code>set.5
</code>, then type:
</p>


<pre><strong>
:r set.5
"h3dd@h

</strong></pre>


<p>to read the file into your editing buffer, then the

<code><strong>"h3dd@h
</strong></code> command will delete those
three lines -- which came from the external file -- into the
``h'' named buffer, then execute the same lines as set-up
commands.

<p><em>You asked for it, and it's here!

Most of the e-mail I receive about this tutorial asks me how to
do some specific kind of editing with Vi.  The most popular
re
quest so far has been for techniques to edit material in
columns, and that's what I explain in the 
<a href="009.part6.html">next installment
</a>. Then it's on to the
treacherous, albeit important, topic of addresses for screen-mode
commands.
