<h3>The Wondrous Global Command
</h3>


<p>If you're surprised that I made no mention of

<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> in the 
<a href="009.part2.html">preceding installment of this tutorial
</a>
-- well, 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> is not an address.
It's actually a line-mode command, and it's much more powerful
than most users suspect.
</p>


<p><a name="target01"></a>Even experienced users of line mode
</a>
usually think of 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> along
these lines: ``If you type 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code>
and then a search pattern and then a line-mode command, all on
one line, then the editor finds every line in the file that
contains that pattern and runs the command on every one o
f those
lines''. That is, typing:
</p>


<pre><strong>
global /^Chapter [1-9]/ delete

</strong></pre>


<p>is expected to find and delete every line in the file that starts
with a chapter heading.  This example will do just that, and so will
many other such uses of the command.  But spectacular failures
will happen from time to time--typing:
</p>


<pre><strong>

<a name="write"></a>global /^Chapter [1-9]/ write &gt;&gt; t.of.contents
</a>

</strong></pre>


<p>definitely will 
<strong>not
</strong> append each of the marked lines
to a file named ``t.of.contents'', as moderately experienced users
might expect.  (It's likely to overflow your file system quota
instead.)
</p>



<h3><a name="section1"></a>The Details of Global Operations
</h3>


<p>More important, misunderstanding the 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command
keeps users from exploiting more than a small fraction of that
command's power.  But you don't have to live with the limitations of
ignorance on this--here's the full story in plain terms:
</p>


<dl>


<dt>Sear
ching where you tell it to look:

   
<dd><p>As a line-mode command, 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> can be
   preceded by an address or pair of addresses.  Its default is
   to search the entire file, but if you start your command as
   
<code>257 , 382 global
</code> then it will only search through
   lines 257 through 382 inclusive.  Any line-mode addresses can
   begin a 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command, so starting with
   
<code>?^Exercises? +++ , $ global
</code> will restrict the pattern
   search and line marking to a stretch beginning three lines past
   the last previous line that starts with the string ``Exercises'',
   and ending at the end of the file.
</p>


<dt>Marking either hits or misses:

   
<dd><p>Typing the command name as 
<code>global
</code> or
   
<code>g
</code> will definitely cause it to mark every line
   in the search area that contains the pattern.  But typing it as
   
<code>global!
</code> or 
<code>g!
</code> or 
<code>v
</code>
   reverses the procedure--now it will only
 mark lines that do
   
<strong>not
</strong> contain the search string.  So if you are
   editing a copy of a log file of error messages, and only the
   lines that begin with ``Error 3b:'' are of interest, you can
   eliminate all the unwanted lines by typing:
</p>

   
<pre><strong>
   global! /^Error 3b:/ delete
   
</strong></pre>


<dt>Choose your own search pattern delimiter:

   
<dd><p>Since this command always searches the file (or the section
   of it that you select) from top to bottom, you can use almost any
   punctuation character to mark the start and end of your search
   pattern.  There's no need to use ? or / characters to indicate a
   direction for the search.  If you want to eliminate lines that
   contain three consecutive slash marks, any of:
</p>

   
<pre><strong>
   global +///+ delete
   global ;///; delete
   global ]///] delete
   
</strong></pre>

   
<p>will be a simpler choice than using slashes as delimiters and
   backslashing all three of the slashes you are searching for.
   (However
, using 
<code>!
</code> as you delimiter is dangerous,
   because 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> is likely to mistake your
   delimiter for the switch that tells it to find only lines that
   do 
<strong>not
</strong> contain the search pattern.)
</p>

   
<p>Of course this applies only to the search pattern that goes
   right after the 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command name, 
   the one that says which lines to mark.  If you use any search patterns
   before the command name, to say which area of the file is to
   be searched, then use ? and / delimiters as usual.
</p>


<dt><a name="target10"></a>Global searches that seem senseless
</a> 
   can be very useful:

   
<dd><p>At times it's wise to have 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> or
   
<code><strong>:global
</strong>!
</code> run a search over just one 
   line in a file.
   This is the basis for conditional execution of line-mode commands.
   As a simple example, you may find yourself editing files from
   outside your organization that are somet
imes (but not always)
   sent to you with an extra, empty last line, as a spacer.
   You need to remove that last line, if and only if it is empty.
   You could go the end of each file and look, but it's easier
   to have the editor do the checking and (where necessary) the
   deletion, so you type:
</p>

   
<pre><strong>
   $ global /^$/ delete
   
</strong></pre>

   
<p><a name="target09"></a>It can also be useful
</a> to have 
   
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> mark every
   line in the area of the file you tell it to search!  Our put-upon
   programmer, Hal (in the first installment of this tutorial) used
   this when he had to reverse the order of the lines in one file.
   His command line, which would look like this if typed out in
   unabbreviated form:
</p>

   
<pre><strong>
   global /^/ move 0
   
</strong></pre>

   
<p>begins by marking each line that has a start-of-line point,
   which makes every line qualify.  Next it goes to the first line
   and moves it up right after the fictitious line zero--a
 no-op,
   of course.  But then it moves the second line to the same place,
   pushing the former first line down one
   position in the file.  As it does the same with the third line,
   the fourth line, etcetera, it's changing the order of the lines
   to the exact opposite of the order they were in at the start.
</p>


<dt>One 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> can run many commands:

   
<dd><p>You can put several commands on the line after a
   
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command and its search pattern.  After
   marking the appropriate lines, 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> will then
   go to each marked line and run all of the commands you've
   given it, in the order you gave them.  Just separate these
   commands with a vertical bar (``|'') character.  
<a name="chapter"></a>If you type:
</a></p>

   
<pre><strong>
   global /^CHAPTER/ substitute /APTER/apter/ | copy $
   
</strong></pre>

   
<p>the editor will go to each line that starts with a chapter
   heading, change ``CHAPTER'' to ``
Chapter'', and then copy the
   line (now beginning ``Chapter'' instead of ``CHAPTER'') to
   the end of the file.  The order in which you put those two
   commands is important -- the 
<code>substitute
</code> command
   must come first so the subsequent 
<code>copy
</code> command
   will copy the decapitalized version of the line, not the
   original all-caps version.
</p>

   
<p>You're not limited to just two commands in a
   
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command line; there is no maximum on the
   number of commands there.  The maximum string length for the
   command list varies with the editor version you're using, but
   I've never encountered a limit of less then 256 characters.
   There are a few restrictions on what the command list can
   contain, though:
</p>

      
<ul>

      
<li>The 
<code>global
</code> keyword and the following list of
      commands all must be on one line.  (That is, on one physical
      line, with no carriage returns in it.  If that one line is too
      long for your te
rminal's screen width, the terminal may wrap it
      around to occupy two or more lines on your screen, but this
      will not cause a problem.)
</li>
   
      
<li>The command list cannot include an 
<code>undo
</code>
      or another 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command.
</li>

      
<li>If you include a command that escapes to the shell, it
      must be the last command on the line.  (Putting two or more
      shell-escape commands in one command list will not work.)
      This makes it possible to use pipes (symbolized by the
      
<code>|
</code> character) in your shell-escape command string,
      without having the editor mistake the pipe symbol for the
      separator between two editor commands in your
      
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command line.
</li>

      
</ul><br><br>


<dt>Commands don't have to run on the lines 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> marks.

   
<dd><p>Using 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> is essentially the same as
   moving to each marked line manually
, then typing in the
   command string while you are there.  Just as you no longer
   expect every command you type in to operate on the line you
   are on when you type it, you don't have to have the commands
   in a 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> string operate entirely on the
   marked lines.  Here are three points to note regarding this:
</p>

      
<ol>

      
<li><p>Any command in a 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command line can
      take its own address or addresses, just as it could if it
      were typed in as a separate command.  So this command
      string:
</p>

      
<pre><strong>
      global /^XX/ - copy $ | /ZZ$/ , +5 delete
      
</strong></pre>

      
<p>is entirely legitimate.  It goes to each line that begins
      with two capital X's, then copies the line just before that
      one to the end of the file, and finally goes forward to the
      next line that ends with two capital Z's and deletes that
      line and the five lines that follow it.
</p></li>

      
<li><p>Even
 if you give no addresses for the commands in a
      
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> string, default addresses for those
      commands may make them operate on other than the marked line.
      That's the fault in that 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command string
      
<a href="009.part3.html#write">in the introduction
</a> to this installment
      of my tutorial that tries to write individual lines to
      another file.  Because the default address for the
      
<code>write
</code> command is the entire file, this command
      will write the entire file the user is editing to the
      end of the other file,
      once for every line that 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> 
      has marked.
      The correct way to write individual lines is to type:
</p>

      
<pre><strong>
      global /^Chapter [1-9]/ . write &gt;&gt; t.of.contents
      
</strong></pre>

      
<p>where the dot address in front of the 
<code>write
</code>
      command tells it to write only the line it is on.
</p></li>

      
<li><p>But
 even if you take a command that has the current
      line as its default address, and put it in the string
      following 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> without giving it an address
      of its own, it can still operate on different lines from the
      ones 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code>has marked if it is not the first
      command in the string.  The reason: each subsequent command
      in a 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> takes as the current line whatever
      line the command before it left as the current line.
</p>

      
<p>In my 
<a href="009.part3.html#chapter">earlier example
</a> about wanting
      to both change the capitalization of lines beginning with
      ``CHAPTER'' and copy those lines to the end of the file, the
      task was easy because the lines were to be copied in their
      changed state.  But what if the user wanted only the lines
      in the midst of the file decapitalized, while the ones copied
      to the end of the file were to remain all-caps?  It might
      se
em obvious to simply reverse the order of the two commands,
      so the 
<code>copy
</code> command was executed first, before
      the 
<code>substitute
</code> command was called to change the
      capitalization, like this:
</p>

      
<pre><strong>
      global /^CHAPTER/ copy $ | substitute /APTER/apter/
      
</strong></pre>

      
<p>Surprisingly, that would produce the opposite of the
      effect that was intended.  That is, it would decapitalize
      the copied lines at the end of the file, but leave the
      marked lines in the midst of the file all-caps.
      The reason?  The 
<code>copy
</code> command leaves the last
      line of the copy text block, not the original text block, as
      the current line.  So after the 
<code>copy
</code> command
      has run, the 
<code>substitute
</code> command, using the
      command's default address (the current line) because it
      has not been given an explicit address, would operate on
      the copy line rather than the original.
</p>

      
<p>But ther
e is one thing that no amount of current-line
      shifting can change.  Wherever in the file the command
      string may leave the current line, when the commands have
      finished running, 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> will go to the next
      marked line without fail.  The only way any of the commands
      in the string can prevent this is by deleting the next
      marked line -- in that case, 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> will
      merely go on to the next marked line that has not been
      deleted.  And even this fact has uses that might not
      be obvious.
</p>

      
<p>Let's say you want to thin out the lines in a file,
      by deleting every second line.  You can do it by typing:
</p>

      
<pre><strong>
      global /^/ + delete
      
</strong></pre>

      
<p>This 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> starts off by marking every line.
      When it goes to line 1, the command it executes will delete
      line 2.  The next undeleted marked line is line 3, where its

      command deletes line 4, and so on.  Or if you want to delete
      two-thirds of the lines in your file, type:
</p>

      
<pre><strong>
      global /^/ + , ++ delete
      
</strong></pre></li>

      
</ol>


</dl>



<h3><a name="section2"></a>A Few More Uses for Global Commands
</a></h3>


<p>The examples above are designed to show not only the working
principles of the 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command, but also some
of the less-obvious tricks it can do.  But I couldn't fit every
important trick in above.  Here are some more that are well
worth knowing.
</p>


<p><strong>Keeping Count.
</strong>  At times it's a good idea
to follow 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> with a string of commands that
have absolutely nothing to do with the lines that

<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> has marked.  The most common occasion for
this comes when you need to repeat a line-mode command a
certain number of times.
</p>


<p>At tradeshows I'm often invited to test a system right there
on the show floor.  I can't ca
rry a 10,000-line test file along
with me in every media and format any system might require, so
I type in a ten-line file on the spot and expand it by telling
the editor ten times to make a copy of the entire file and put
that copy at the end of the present file.  (Each such copy doubles
the file's size, so I wind up with 10,240 lines.)
</p>


<p>But that requires accurate counting.  If I'm off by even one
on the number of times I type that command in, I get a half-size
or double-size file that ruins my test results.  Instead of
trying to count without an error, I let the editor do the
counting for me.  After I've typed in the initial ten lines,
I give one 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command:
</p>


<pre><strong>
global /^/ % copy $

</strong></pre>


<p>This tells the editor to search the ten lines of the file,
mark every line that has a start-of-line (which means every line,
of course), and then go to each of those ten lines and run the
subsequent command to make a whole-file copy.  This guarantees
tha
t the command will run exactly ten times.
</p>


<p>Not that this trick is limited to files that have exactly
as many lines as the number of times I want to command to be
repeated.  If I had typed in a twenty-line file, I could copy
it ten times by giving my 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> as:
</p>


<pre><strong>
1 , 10 global /^/ % copy $

</strong></pre>


<p><strong>Moving Around Automatically.
</strong> At times you
may need to handle a series of editing problems in a file,
where the edits must be dealt with one by one, not with a

<strong>:global
</strong> editing script.  But moving to each spot where work
needs to be done can be a very tedious business.  If there is
a text pattern that identifies each place that needs editing,
or if you can write a script to insert such a pattern, as Hal
did at the start of this tutorial's first installment, then

<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> can move you around automatically.
</p>


<p>You may recall that Hal used a script to mark up the legacy
source code, puttin
g each 
<code>lint
</code> warning at the
end of the source line to which it referred, preceded by "XXX"
to make the affected lines identifiable.  Suppose that the
nefarious Vice President for Information Systems comes back
to Hal to demand that each warning be investigated, to see
whether the code can be rewritten to eliminate the warning.
</p>


<p>Should Hal just leaf through the code, searching for XXX
patterns to guide him to the trouble spots?  Hal knows that with
the spaghetti code he's facing, the actual problem may be a long
way from the line 
<code>lint
</code> has designated.  In
traveling to the actual trouble spot he may have passed several
XXX patterns along the way, so searching for the next XXX in the
file may bring him to a site he's already dealt with, or may miss
a number of XXX sites that he passed when he moved forward to get
to the actual problem spot on the previous fix.  Besides, because
he frequently does pattern searching while fixing a problem, he
can't depend on a visual-mode 
<code>n
</code> command to use the
XXX pattern he needs to find; he must type the pattern in afresh
each time.
</p>


<p>But Hal knows a way around all this--dropping back to line mode
(by typing a capital letter Q from visual mode) and giving a simple

<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command:
</p>


<pre><strong>
global /XXX/ visual | write

</strong></pre>


<p>This command brings Hal to the first "XXX" line, where it puts
him into visual mode to do his editing.  When the edit is
finished, Hal simply types a capital letter Q and the editor
takes him to the second "XXX" line and puts him into visual mode
there, no matter how much moving around Hal did during the first
edit, and so on through the list of "XXX" lines.  As frosting on
the cake, the 
<code>write
</code> command automatically writes the
changed file to disk after each individual edit.
</p>



<h3><a name="section3"></a>Now You Give it a Try
</a></h3>


<p>Here are a few exercises you can try to solve, before you
start using advanced 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> tactics in your own
editing.  To keep things rolling I've provided at least one
solution to each exercise, and also a hint on the last (and
toughest) problem.
</p>


<p><strong>Copy and Decapitalize.
</strong>  Let's think back
to the user who wanted to find each line in the file that
begins with "CHAPTER", then copy each such line to the end
of the file just as it is, and finally change the start of
each original line (in mid-file) from "CHAPTER" to "Chapter"
while leaving the copied lines (at the end of the file)
beginning "CHAPTER".
</p>


<p>We've already learned that this cannot be done with either
of:
</p>


<pre><strong>
global /^CHAPTER/ substitute /APTER/apter/ | copy $
global /^CHAPTER/ copy $ | substitute /APTER/apter/

</strong></pre>


<p>What 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> command (or commands) would it take
to do what's desired here?  Finding a 
<a href="009.ans.part3.html#copy">solution
</a> to this is not
difficult when there are so many workable ones.
</p>



<p><strong>A Precise String Length.
</strong>  An old friend who
does some pretty tricky work with 
<code>troff
</code> often
needs to insert a string of backslashes in a line--up to 64
of them in a row.  The count of backslashes must be exactly
right or 
<code>troff
</code> will choke.  How can he get these
strings exactly right without tedious counting and checking?
</p>


<p>Let's say he needs to put 16 backslashes in line 217, right
before the string "n(PDu". What command(s) should he use to get
them in there without hand counting.  My 
<a href="009.ans.part3.html#troff">solution
</a> is pretty plain once
you know which commands to use.
</p>



<p><strong>Numbering Paragraphs.
</strong>  A documentation writer
has divided each section of a document into paragraphs, and as a

<code>troff
</code> user, marks the start of each paragraph by a
line that contains the macro ".pp" only.  That is, a break
between paragraphs looks like this:
</p>


<pre><strong>
which is the only way that argon gas can be dissolved
in this liquid.

.pp
The problem of energizing the
 argon to fluorescence while
it is dissolved was first approached by applying a strong

</strong></pre>


<p>How can this tech writer use the vi editor to number the
paragraphs in each section?  (If this seems far-fetched to
you, consider that I once got a phone call from a Unix guru
asking how to do just this.)  To keep the problem simple, let's
say that there are never more than 35 paragraphs in a section,
and that they should be numbered with Roman numerals.
</p>


<p>This problem is still difficult enough that I'm offering you
two hints.  The first is that 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code> is essential
here.  Look at the second 
<a href="009.ans.part3.html#hint-number">hint
</a> only if you're
about to give up and check my 
<a href="009.ans.part3.html#solution-number">solution
</a>.
</p>



<h3><a name="next"></a>Coming Up Next
</a></h3>


<p>In the 
<a href="009.part4.html">next part of this tutorial
</a>, I'll cover
the less-known aspects of the other line-mode commands for
dealing with text and files.  If you're a l
ittle overwhelmed with
all that I've said about 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code>,
you'll be pleased to know that 
<code>substitute
</code> is notably
simpler, and all the remaining commands are very much simpler,
than 
<code><strong>:global
</strong></code>.
</p>


<p>After that, future parts of this tutorial will deal with
visual mode; easier and more fun than line mode any day.
</p>
